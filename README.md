# GuidBase64

A wrapper for `System.Guid` that enables easy conversion of GUIDs to and from base 64 strings.

The base 64 representation uses a modified, URL-safe character set based on YouTube's base 64 character set (i.e. `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-` and `_`).

Some of the code here is referenced from [this blog post by Mads Kristensen](https://madskristensen.net/blog/a-shorter-and-url-friendly-guid/).
